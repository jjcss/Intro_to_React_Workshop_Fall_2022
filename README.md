## Tip Calculator App

**Description**: We will be building a simple one screen Tip Calculator application in Xcode using the power of Swift.
**App Features**: 
- The User will be able to add in an original amount. Let's say the user enters an amount of **$50.00**. After a user enters an amount, they will be able to choose the **tip percentage** that they'd like to calculate an amount for. The three tip choices that they will have is **15%, 20%, and 25%**. Based on a choice, our application will calculate the new total amount with the tip percentate. Let's say the user picks **20%** as the tip percentage. Our application will display the new total amount, with the initial price of $100 + 25% tip, which should be **$120**.
- We will add images to our application (specifically the CSS Club's logo). These images, will be on our **main application screen, the loading screen of our app, and as an icon of our app**.
- We will also stylize our application.

## Pre Requisites
- [ ] **Mac Users**: 
    - [ ] Make sure you have [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) downloaded.
        - Xcode includes everything you need to develop, test, and distribute apps across all Apple platforms. Leverage the simplicity and power of Swift with a new multiplatform app experience and code faster with enhanced editor features. Creating amazing apps has never been easier. In other words, it's an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
        - Xcode is a bulky application so it might take you a good amount of time to get it to fully download.
- [ ] **Window Users**:
    - [ ] Since Apple only allows iOS Development with Swift and Xcode on MacOS, Window users have to use a virtual machine like **Virtual Box** to be able to use these tools.
        - VirtualBox is a cross-platform virtualization software. It allows users to extend their existing computer to run multiple operating systems including Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and Oracle Solaris, at the same time.
        - [Click here](https://www.wikihow.com/Download-Xcode-on-PC-or-Mac) to learn how to download/install VirtualBox, download Xcode and begin your iOS Development learning.

> Note: Please allocate some time for these steps as they take a long time to get set up/downloaded.

# iOS Development Demo

## Step 0 - Open up Xcode & Create a New Project

1) Open up your Xcode Application
    <details>
    <summary>You should see this on your screen</summary>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/RCQU2Wp.png" alt="drawing" width="300" height="200"/>
    </details>
2) Click on `Create a New Xcode Project`
    <details>
    <summary>Example</summary>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/cU7YmCl.png" alt="drawing" width="400" height="80"/>
    </details>
    
3) You should now see a new screen asking you to choose a template for your project. We want to build and app, so let's select the `iOS Tab` and under `Application` let's select `App`
    <details>
    <summary>Example of configuration for our template</summary>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/biYJMqy.png" alt="drawing" width="400" height="200"/>
    </details>
    
4) You should now see options a few options to further configure your project. We will just be focusing on `Product Name`, `Interface` and `Language`. Name your project whatever you'd like. For `Interface` choose, `Storyboard` (we'll get more into what Storyboard is in the following steps). For language, select `Swift`. Then, click `Next`.

    <summary>More configuration of project</summary>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/7A48vcM.png" alt="drawing" width="400" height="200"/>
    </details>
    
5) You should now see a window asking you to save your project anywhere on your system. One you choose where you want to save your project folder, click on `Create`.

6) You have succesfully created a new Xcode Project File. We can now begin building our application ðŸ’».
1) Open up your Xcode Application
    <details>
    <summary>Newly created project</summary>

    </details>

>Take some time to look over the various files you now see and all tabs. Also check out video below to see all steps done for `Step 0`.

## Step 1 - Creating App Design

**Description**: In this step we will begin designing our application in our `Main Storyboard`.

    <summary>Finished product for this step</summary>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/6SCeUyj.png" alt="drawing" width="170" height="300"/>
    </details>

0) Let's head over to our `Main Storyboard` file, located on the left side of Xcode. This section on the left side is referred as the `Project Navigator`. You should now see an iPhone like screen. Here is where we will design our application. <br>

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71786791/197360059-4afba473-5760-4a93-aae9-0d618864383d.mov

1) Let's locate `Xcode's Library Components` button. It should be a `+` at the top right corner of the middle section of our current screen. Click on it, and now you should see a pop-up displaying various components. If you click on a component, you will see a description of what they each do. <br>

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71786791/197360120-0d1ccbc9-5e72-43d6-906a-9960c1f22be4.mov
    
2) Now, let's search up `label`, click on it and drag it on to the `View Controller`. Let's try to place it at the top of our screen, directly in the middle. We will be using this label to display the name of our application "Tip Calculator". <br>

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71786791/197360165-c0c2dc7c-886c-49a0-948c-f28a95c1e9c1.mov
 
3) Next, let's double click on the label, and let's give it a name of `Tip Calculator`. Make sure you center the text to the middle of the screen again. Let's then go to the right side of our screen, known as the `Inspection Secton`, and let's locate the `Font section`. Click on the `T` button, click on `style` and select the `bold` selection. This will bolden our label. That is all we will do with this label. <br>

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71786791/197360202-3b548347-396f-48d1-90fd-f36b25ec8709.mov

4) Next, let's access our component's library again, click `+` button on the top right corner of the middle section. Search up `Image`, and drag the `Image View` onto your screen. Place it right below our `Tip Calculator` label and center it. We will use this component to display the CSS Logo. <br>
